    abstract="As older adults embrace social media, their engagement extends across diverse platforms, each offering unique features and benefits. This study investigates platform-swinging among older adults, where they strategically switch between platforms to fulfill specific needs and desires. We interviewed 11 older adults living in the Philippines in November of 2023 who used at least two social media platforms. The platform combination favored by older adults varies based on their context. However, a common combination observed in this study included Facebook, Messenger, and YouTube. Guided by the Uses and Gratification Theory, we applied thematic analysis and revealed four major themes that motivate older adults to practice platform-swinging: managing digital ties, transferring information, uplifting and managing emotions, and optimizing work processes. The respondents' ability to practice platform-swinging is facilitated by adequate internet connectivity and devices, and familiarity with the different platforms.",

               understanding of the issues in the country and their engagement
               in politics is crucial. The key aim of this study is to
               investigate the relationship between exposure to social media to
               the awareness on various social issues and the complex political
               involvement of youth. The study employed a correlational design
               of quantitative research approach use to analyze data gathered
               based on the conducted online survey of senior high school
               students from Tanauan City Integrated High School. In addition,
               this study applied a Pearson correlation to determine if a
               significant correlation existed. Findings showed that there is
               no significant connection between the respondents' social media
               exposure and their level of awareness regarding societal issues
               in the country. On the other hand, there is a significant
               relationship between the respondents' social media exposure and
               their level of radical involvement. This research demonstrates
               how a broader and more advanced understanding of youth's radical
               political participation associated with more comprehensive
               measures of social media use can help better understand the role
               of digital platforms in influencing political participatory
               behavior and awareness among the internet generation. It is
               recommendable that future researchers could focus on a different
               aspect, highlighting the effects of specific social media
               platform to bring in-depth information about its implications to
               the political behaviors and awareness of youth in this

    abstract="Instagram is a popular social networking application, which allows photo-sharing and applying different photo filters to adjust the appearance of a picture. By applying these filters, users are able to create a style that they want to express to their audience. In this study we tried to infer personality traits from the way users manipulate the appearance of their pictures by applying filters to them. To investigate this relationship, we studied the relationship between picture features and personality traits. To collect data, we conducted an online survey where we asked participants to fill in a personality questionnaire, and grant us access to their Instagram account through the Instagram API. Among 113 participants and 22,398 extracted Instagram pictures, we found distinct picture features (e.g., relevant to hue, brightness, saturation) that are related to personality traits. Our findings suggest a relationship between personality traits and these picture features. Based on our findings, we also show that personality traits can be accurately predicted. This allow for new ways to extract personality traits from social media trails, and new ways to facilitate personalized systems.",

               Statistical features were computationally extracted from 43,950

               components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models
               outperformed general practitioners' average unassisted

               when the analysis was restricted to posts made before depressed
               individuals were first diagnosed. Human ratings of photo
               attributes (happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of
               depression, and were uncorrelated with computationally-generated

  title     = "Do Instagram profiles accurately portray personality? An
               investigation into idealized online self-presentation",
  author    = "Harris, Elspbeth and Bardey, Aurore C",
  abstract  = "Instagram users are consistently exposed to the presentation of
               idealized selves. Although studies have examined online
               self-presentation in general, little attention has been paid to
               self-presentation in a visual online setting, such as Instagram.
               The present investigation examined the extent to which Instagram
               account holders engage in idealized online self-presentation
               through a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative results (Study 1)
               showed a difference between how the observers perceived the
               Instagram account holders' personality and the Instagram account
               holders' personality self-reports. Qualitative findings (Study
               2) revealed four major themes: (1) Selfies as a personality
               predictor; (2) Faces as a personality predictor; (3) Layout as
               personality predictor, (4) Misuse of social networks and its
               consequence for communication. Our results also indicated that
               the halo effect is integral to the online self-presentational
               process, suggesting that an aesthetically pleasing Instagram
               account or account holder will be better received and thought as
               having particularly positive personality traits.",
