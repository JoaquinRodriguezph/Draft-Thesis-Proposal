%%Follow the inverted pyramid to describe each of the following. Allocate one (1) paragraph per level in the pyramid. 

% Describe the research area
Personality is defined as “patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}. In a society, people develop opinions and treat each other differently based on their perception of the person’s personality. Understanding personality plays a significant role in fields such as psychology as this information can be used in studies of mental health and human behavior. Alongside the rise of publicly available and easily accessible information on social networking sites (SNS), the field of personality computing has begun to garner increasing interest in the last few years. 

%Research area ...
%This study's main research area is on personality computing. Personality computing is related to artificial intelligence and personality psychology by studying one's personality through a variety of computational techniques from different sources (usually text, multimedia, and social networks). Among the three main problems personality computing addresses; automatic personality recognition, perception, and synthesis \citep[p.~280]{Vinciarelli2014}; this study focuses on automatic personality recognition.
Personality computing integrates artificial intelligence and personality psychology by analyzing personality traits using a variety of computational techniques from various data sources, such as text, multimedia, and social networks. In this area of study, personality often represented as quantifiable traits, with the Big Five Personality model being a widely used framework. The Big Five model categorizes personality into five traits, namely: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness neuroticism, and openness. 

Personality computing research is commonly divided into three subfields: Automatic Personality Recognition (APR), Automatic Personality Perception (APP), and Automatic Personality Synthesis (APS) \citep{Vinciarelli2014}.

% Describe the domain (where will you apply the topic)
Automatic personality recognition (APR) aims to infer the personality of an individual based on their digital footprint. APR has been traced back to the work of \citet{Pennebaker1999} wherein they asked the question of \textit{can language use reflect personality style?}

% Give a synthesis of previous work

% Synthesis of previous studies...
%\citet{Pennebaker1999} and \citet{Mairesse2007} had demonstrated the different ways of detecting personalities and emotions by analyzing the text with various language models. Due to that, social media had became a common place for the research of personality detection. The PagkataoKo dataset has been made with social media activity on Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter). There were more studies using X's data than Instagram due to X being a more prominent platform with its text-based posts. However, \citet{ferwerda2016}, \cite{Reece2017-qw} and \cite{Harris2019-gq} made studies that showed analyzing photos was possible. Thus, researching on Instagram became more meaningful in this manner.
Previous studies have found success in the implementation of deep learning and deep neural networks in the field of APR \citep{Zhao2022}. The standard approach involves feature extraction, followed by machine learning techniques to associate extracted features with personality traits. Common models include deep neural networks (DNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). 

The widespread adoption of social media has further propelled APR research, providing large-scale, real-time behavioral data for personality inference. Studies suggest that social media interactions exhibit behavior that is “spontaneous and self-disclosing beyond intention” \citep{Vinciarelli2014}, making them valuable for personality analysis. Thus, many studies have taken to conducting personality analysis using data from personal social media profiles. Text was a common modality in their research, though a smaller number of papers have also explored image-based analysis. 

Despite growing research in APR, most studies have primarily focused on Western populations. Limited research has explored personality inference methods within Filipino contexts, particularly in using image-based data.

% State the problem and the research question

% Paragraph containing the Problem Statement or the Research Question.

This study seeks to explore image-based APR methods tailored for Filipino users by leveraging Instagram data, integrating psychological analysis and computational techniques. The study aims to address the question: \textit{How can Instagram content, including images and captions, be used to infer a Filipino’s personality traits based on psychological and computational analysis?}

% This section ends with a discussion on the problem/s faced by or that still exist in the specific technology or field (e.g., limitations of existing software or algorithms). It should not contain your research objectives or goal; instead, the problem statement would lead to the research objectives to be stated in 1.2.

% \subsection{Figures}

% Often times, a graph, illustration, screenshot, or any image can help a reader better understand what we say in text. In academic writing, we call them \textbf{figures}. Please add as many figures as necessary to help build your narrative, but do not go overboard. 

% You can add figures in JPG or PNG format as shown in Figure \ref{fig:disneystock}. All figures should also have a descriptive caption. As a general principle, your caption should adequately describe what is shown in the figure, and not just short texts. If we remove all the surrounding text, the reader should still understand what your figure is. 

% All figures should be referred to at least once in the surrounding paragraphs. Make sure that you explain what the figure is all about, and that you refer to your figure. You can also use the surround paragraphs to highlight key insights or parts of your figure. For example, \figref{fig:disneystock} shows a graph of the performance of Disney stock from the 1980s to 2012.

% %--- the following example shows how to include a figure in PNG format
% \begin{figure}[t]                %-- use [t] to place figure at top, [b] to place at the bottom, [h] for here
%    \centering                    %-- use this to center the figure
%    \includegraphics{DisneyChart.png}      %-- include image file named as "disneychart.png" 
%    \caption{Disney's stock price chart from the 1980s up to 2012. The top chart shows the stock price in each month. The bottom chart shows the change in volume of transactions. The bars are colored based on the type of movement that happened in a month.}
%     \label{fig:disneystock}

% \section{Research Objectives}

% This subsection states the over--all goal that must be achieved to answer the problem. Address the following: Given your research challenge or opportunity, how do you intend to solve it? What is the main outcome of your research? What kind of contribution do you want to achieve?

% The \textbf{general objective} is broken down into three or more specific objectives. The \textbf{specific objectives} are relatively smaller objectives that help you attain your general objective. You can formulate your specific objectives based on your running questions about the project. For example, the group does not have a good picture yet of the different conversation patterns between humans that can be mimicked by conversational agents. A specific objective can be "to identify different human-human conversation patterns." These objectives must be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bounded.

% Reviewing related literature, studying a particular programming language or development tool (e.g., to study Windows/Object-Oriented/Graphics/C++ programming), and documentation to accomplish the general objective is inherent in all thesis projects and, therefore, must not be included here.

\section{Significance of the Research}
\label{sec: Significance}

To our knowledge, image features in Filipino APR have not been explored yet. Therefore, exploring this would maybe give better insights on how images from Filipino Instagram Users tell their personality.  While existing studies have largely focused on textual data from platforms like Twitter, our study expands the scope by incorporating visual elements from Instagram and fusing these two features: textual data and image data. 

This study also addresses the underrepresentation of Filipino social media data in personality recognition research. By utilizing data in both English and Filipino languages alongside visual content, this research displays whether there is a significant improvement in predicting the personality of Filipinos when integrating image features as well. Moreover, this study investigates whether combining text and image features results in a significant improvement in personality prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches. 

Apart from benefiting Filipino APR research, this study possibly benefits marketing, advertising, and social networking platforms as well. In \cite{Matz2017} study on Psychological Targeting in Digital Marketing, it was found that by aligning ad content with the personality traits of target audiences, marketers can enhance engagement and conversion rates (the percentage of users who take a desired action after being exposed to a targeted advertisement). 

%%This section explains why research must be done in this area.  It rationalizes the objective of the research with that of the stated problem. Avoid including sentences such as ``This research will be beneficial to the proponent/department/college'' as this is already an inherent requirement of all BS and MS thesis projects.  Focus on the research's contribution to the Computer Science field.
